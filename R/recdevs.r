#' Randomly generated standard-normal recruitment deviations
#'
#' These data are randomly generated recruitment deviations with mean
#' 0 and standard deviation 1. For legacy reasons (i.e. the matrix
#' size was enlarged in the middle of a study) they were generated
#' with this code:
#' \code{
#' recdevs <- matrix(nrow = 150, ncol = 1000)
#' set.seed(999)
#' recdevs[1:100,   1:100] <- matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 100, data = rnorm(100*100))
#' recdevs[1:100, 101:500] <- matrix(nrow = 100, ncol = 400, data = rnorm(100*400))
#' recdevs[101:150, 1:500] <- matrix(nrow = 50,  ncol = 500, data = rnorm(50*500))
#' recdevs[1:150, 501:1000] <- matrix(nrow = 150, ncol = 500, data = rnorm(150*500))
#' save(recdevs, file = "../data/recdevs.rda")
#' }
#' The columns are intended to be for iterations and the rows for
#' years. The matrix has intentionally constructed at a large size to
#' accommodate studies that work with simulations up to 150 years
#' long and with up to 1000 iterations. If you want to work with more
#' iterations or longer time series then you'll need to specify your
#' own recdevs through the \code{user_recdevs} argument in
#' \code{\link{ss3sim_base}}. The function
#' \code{\link{change_rec_devs}} will throw out extra years of
#' recruitment deviations.
